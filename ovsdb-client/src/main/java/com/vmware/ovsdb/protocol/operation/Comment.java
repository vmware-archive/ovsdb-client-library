/**

 * The "comment" object contains the following members:
 *
 *    "op": "comment"                    required
 *    "comment": <string>                required
 *
 * There is no corresponding result object.
 *
 * The operation provides information to a database administrator on the
 * purpose of a transaction.  The ovsdb-server implementation, for
 * example, adds comments in transactions that modify the database to
 * the database journal.  This can be helpful in debugging, e.g., when
 * there are multiple clients writing to a database.  An example of this
 * can be seen in the ovs-vsctl tool, a command line tool that interacts
 * with ovsdb-server.  When performing operations on the database, it
 * includes the command that was invoked (e.g., "ovs-vsctl add-br br0")
 * as a comment in the transaction, which can then be seen in the
 * journal alongside the changes that were made to the tables in the
 * database.
